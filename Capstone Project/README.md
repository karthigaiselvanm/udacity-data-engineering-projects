I have done an open ended project to analyze the World Development Indicators(WDI) to find which is the most suitable country to start up a Business after the impact of Covid-19.

Dataset Used was obtained from https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/dataset/world-development-indicators

The working environment was set up in Docker by following the steps mentioned in the link https://towardsdatascience.com/building-a-spark-and-airflow-development-environment-with-docker-f0b9b625edd8
