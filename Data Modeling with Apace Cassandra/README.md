## Project 2: Data Modeling with Cassandra
In this project, we apply Data Modeling with Cassandra and build an ETL pipeline using Python. We will build a Data Model around our queries that we want to get answers for. 
For our use case we want below answers: 

 - Get details of a song that was herad on the music app history during a particular session. 
 - Get songs played by a user during particular session on music app. 
  - Get all users from the music app history who listened to a particular song.
